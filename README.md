Python based practical for Exoclimes VII cloud modelling review talk

NOTE: The best way to generate a non-irradiated profile (e.g. brown dwarf) is set the zenith angle to a small value (e.g. mu_z = 1e-6), rather than set Tirr = 0. This is just due to the (probably bad) way the semi-grey and picket fence T-p profile calculation was coded.
